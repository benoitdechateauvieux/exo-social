h1. Access Right

In eXo Spaces, there are many ways for a user to become a space member, depending on the space's access right.

We have 2 actions that need to be configured:

* *Visibility of the space*
** *Visible*: the space is listed in the public spaces directory.
** *Hidden*: the space is not listed in the spaces directory.

* *Registration*
** *Open*: A user is free to join a space without any validation needed.
** *Validation*: A user only owns his/her membership after being validated by the space manager.
** *Close*: A user cannot request to become a space member, except that he/she receives an invitation from the space manager.
