5. Click the *Send* button to send the entered values.

After information is sent, you will receive an email with your User name/ Password in your email address registered by yourself.

- If you forget old password: a new password will be set (as temporary). Then, you will be directed to change your password for the next time you sign in.

The User name/Password that you received only have effect for 1 day. It means if the current period is over 1 day from the receipt date, you can not use the received User name/ Password, thus you have to get another email active.
