{info}

By default, applications aren't available for users in eXo Spaces. eXo Spaces leverages the rights on applications defined in the *Application Registry*. Every eXo Space has a group under the group */Spaces*.

There are 2 configuration levels for applications:

- Allow all space managers to install an application: Add the right on an application to the */Spaces* group with a *manager* membership.

1\. Go to *Group* -> *Administration* -> *Application Registry* on the Administration toobar.


2. Click on the application category on the left in order to select it:

3. Click on the *Add Permission* button to open the *Select Permission* form:

4. Select a group as *spaces* on the left pane and a membership on the right pane:

- Allow a specific space to install an application: Add the right on an application to the */Spaces/SpaceName* group (where SpaceName is the name of the space that you want to allow installing the applications) with the *manager* membership.
