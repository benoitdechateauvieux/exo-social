The Proposal
Problem description

What is the problem to fix?

    * When choosing date in mini calendar in french language:

    * the mini calendar allows selecting date in european format (DD/MM/YYYY) but it is saved as an US format (MM/DD/YYYY)
    * french translation of the output date isn't correct: it's appeared as FÃ©vrier 9 2010, but it should be le 2 septembre 2010
    * when the first date (DD) is greater than 12, then the month is count as 12 months + the modulo beetween first date and 12. For example: 16/09/2010 will be displayed as Avril 9 2011

          Date date = this.stringToCalendar(d.toString()).getTime();
          Locale l = WebuiRequestContext.getCurrentInstance().getLocale();
          Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(l) ;
          DateFormat sf = SimpleDateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, l);
          return sf.format(date) ;
